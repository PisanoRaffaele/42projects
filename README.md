Description: 

The 42 School is a programming school that defies traditional education, by enforcing the peer-to-peer methodology, where you learn from and with your peers. There are no assigned teachers in this school. If you're not sure about something, Google, the person next to you or on the bottom of the room are your best options. Just make sure you learn how to learn!

## The 42 program is divided into 3 major events:

### Piscine: 
It is a 4-week, 24/7 full-immersion coding experience aimed at identifying individuals with the potential to become students at 42. Candidates will be selected based on their alignment with the school's philosophy, not necessarily those who have achieved the best results on projects. There will be an exam every week.

### Common Core: 
if you are one of the chosen on the Piscine, there is the main cursus. The process is the same, enroll in projects and unlock new ones until you reach the final one (you'll also have exams). The projects are divided into ranks, and each rank has an exam that must be validated to unlock the next rank.

### Specialization: 
If you would like to explore certain areas of programming, you can enroll in of the available branches of the 42 Program.
